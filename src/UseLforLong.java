/**
 * We are explicitly creating the first variable as long by adding an “L” suffix.
 * So the compiler will treat it as long and assign it to the first variable.
 * For the second statement, the compiler will perform the calculation and treat it as a 32-bit integer.
 * Since the output is outside the range of integer max value (2147483647), the compiler will truncate the most significant bits and then assign it to the variable.
 * Binary equivalent of 1000*60*60*24*365L = 011101010111101100010010110000000000 (36 bits).
 * After removing 4 most significant bits to accommodate in 32-bit int, the new value = 01010111101100010010110000000000 (32 bits).
 * This is equal to 1471228928 and hence the output.
 * Recently I have created a YouTube video series for java tricky programs.
